## Summary
The project titled "Zero Day Options (0DTE) : The High-Stakes World of Same-Day Expirations" investigates the growing prominence of zero-day-to-expiry (0DTE) options within global derivative markets. Drawing insights from reputable sources such as Bloomberg and the Financial Times, the report delves into the complexities of 0DTE options, highlighting key trends including their recent introduction in Europe, a surge in trading volume on Nasdaq, and the participation of both institutional and retail investors.

The study critically examines differing perspectives on whether 0DTE trading exacerbates market volatility, incorporating a discussion on the newly introduced VIX1D index, which measures intraday volatility. Additionally, it reviews two academic papers on 0DTE pricing methodologies without delving into complex mathematics.

Key aspects such as trading mechanisms, strategies, regulatory concerns, and implications for business and economic stability are thoroughly analyzed. The conclusions emphasize the necessity for regulatory oversight to balance innovation with risk mitigation in this rapidly evolving market segment.
